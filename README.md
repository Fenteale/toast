## This is a simplified, extra crispy installer for Open Fortress.

* This installer is currently in development, but you'll notice it's pretty much OFtools/ofatomic.
* This is due to that being the case. I've simplified it to make it easier to work with, using JSON as opposed to SQlite and removing signing.
* This may have a simple GUI to act as a stopgap untill stainless gets finished.
* At the moment, it functions identically to atomic but the packer (used to generate the files) is in this repo to simplify matters.
## Why the name?
* One could ask "Why not?"
