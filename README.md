# ofatomic (oflauncher-atomic)

## This is an alternate launcher for Open Fortress, a free and open-source mod for Team Fortress 2.

* This launcher doesn't have a GUI like stainless, however it's written (as you can see) in Python, which makes this ideal for server operators.

* It is designed to be used by server operators as well as those platforms which don't have official binaries provided for.

*  It's also a lot more simpler due to the lack of GUI + being made in a much quicker timespan.

* ofatomic can also be used as an example to create other launchers.

PRs are welcome.
